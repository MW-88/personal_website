          Monitoring Aquatic Plant Populations in the Nieuwkoopse Plassen Using Satellite Imagery
        </h2>
        <p>
          Aquatic plants play a vital role in maintaining biodiversity within
          the Natura 2000 area of the Nieuwkoopse Plassen in the Netherlands. By
          utilizing a pixel-based random forest machine learning model,
          satellite imagery, and extensive annotations for the model to learn on, we successfully
          identified and monitored aquatic plant populations annually with high
          model accuracy. Unfortunately, the population of aquatic plants has
          been declining each year. Urgent measures are needed to reverse this
          trend and restore their populations.

            Due the largest amount of pixels, because the Nieuwkoopse Plassen is a large region, we have chosen to use DGGS to
            aggregate and visualize the data. More information about what DGGS
            are click

          The resulting trend graphs, which show the total number of hexagons
          containing aquatic plants in the Nieuwkoopse Plassen for each year,
          indicate a downward trend in the population.
          <br><br>
          Unfortunately, we don’t always have cloud-free satellite images of the Nieuwkoopse Plassen during the bloom period. The green line represents satellite images with complete data coverage for the Nieuwkoopse Plassen, while the blue line indicates images with partial data coverage.

        <h2>
        Measuring Traffic Delays in the Province of South Holland to Improve Traffic Conditions Using NDW Data</h2>
        <p>
        The <a href="https://opendata.ndw.nu">NDW</a>  provides various types of open traffic data for the Netherlands. We used floating car data to identify which road sections in the province of South Holland experience significant traffic delays, with the goal of improving the traffic situation in these areas.<br><br>

Floating car data differs from traditional traffic counting devices, for which the NDW provides “meetlus” data. It measures only a subset of traffic from vehicles with active Wi-Fi connections. This means it does not provide exact traffic counts but does measure traffic speed. Additionally, it has a much wider reach, covering almost the entire Netherlands, compared to the limited scope of traditional counting devices.<br><br>

By averaging these speed measurements over a year and comparing them to the maximum free-flow speed, we can estimate the level of delay on specific road sections.<br><br> We use the following formula to calculate delay:
<b>Travel Time / Free-Flow Travel Time.</b> <br><br>

Floating car data from the NDW is substantial. Even when aggregated over a year, it provides data for all roads in the Netherlands in 15-minute intervals. To handle this volume, we used Spark to filter the data to focus only on provincial roads and specific timeframes, such as morning and evening rush hours.

        <h2>Dollar Cost Averaging With Searching For Stock Symbols</h2>

        <p>
          In my search for a dollar-cost averaging calculator, I have yet to find one that allows me to search for different stocks, ETFs, or bonds.

          In short, dollar-cost averaging is an investment strategy where you invest a fixed amount of money in stocks, ETFs, or bonds at regular intervals, typically at the end of each month.
          <br><br>
          To address this, I created a website using Flask, Pandas, Python, and JavaScript that enables users to easily search for various stocks, ETFs, or bonds and compare their performance if a certain amount of money had been invested in the past.
          
          Of course, past performance is not a guarantee of future results, but it still provides valuable information about average returns.
